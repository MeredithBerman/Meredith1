Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg."

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Meredith Berman. I am a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh, with an intended major in Biological Sciences and a minor in Chemistry. I graduated from Moon Area High School in 2024, where I took a variety of elective classes, ranging from woodshop to engineering. I even took a programming class during my junior year. The course I took was an introductory class on the Visual Basic programming language, and it quickly became one of my favorite electives in high school. We had creative freedom with all the apps we created, so I focused my projects on things I enjoy. These often included my favorite artists, holidays, colors, and dream travel vacations. Overall, I had a very positive experience with coding in the past, which has shaped the way I view technology and the programs behind it.</p>

Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>Almost everything we do and see in today’s technological world is due to the code behind the applications. Take TikTok, for example: if you like, comment, or share a TikTok about a certain topic, you are almost guaranteed to see more of that content. The code behind the app feeds you more of what it knows you're interested in, keeping you scrolling for hours. Because of this, it’s easy to only see one side of a story or live in a world filled with content that aligns solely with your preferences. A data visualization activity I completed brought attention to how much I use TikTok on a weekly basis—it was one of my most-used apps. This is because the app's code delivers endless amounts of content related to my interests. These types of addictive algorithms make me concerned for future generations, who will grow up with endless scrolling and unlimited screen time.</p>

  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Comparing what and how I learn in school to what and how my parents learned reveals the drastic evolution of education in parallel with the growth of technology. What used to be taught on chalkboards is now displayed on screens in every classroom. Kids today have endless resources at their fingertips in the form of smartphones, laptops, computers, and more. This is a significant advantage over past generations, who couldn’t simply Google the answers to their questions. Today, code plays a crucial role in many, if not all, classrooms. I’ve been using personalized software since middle school. These applications assess what you know and provide examples and practice in areas where you need improvement. This type of focused learning algorithm has been extremely helpful for me and my classmates, making them valuable resources to take advantage of.</p>

The sooner students learn to use it, the better, so they don’t enter the professional world and fall behind in their field due to not knowing how to use AI to its full potential.</p>
